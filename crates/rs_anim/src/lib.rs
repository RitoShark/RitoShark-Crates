#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
/*!
rs_anim reads and writes League skeleton (`.skl`) and animation (`.anm`) files. The skeleton side
handles the modern `0x22FD4FC3` format: a flat joint list with local and inverse-bind transforms,
the skin-influence list, and skeleton/asset names, round-tripping byte-for-byte. The animation side
reads the uncompressed `r3d2anmd` container in versions 3, 4, and 5, expanding the shared
vector/quaternion palettes into explicit per-joint keyframes, and decodes the compressed `r3d2canm`
container (versions 1-3) by dequantizing and resampling its sparse, per-component keyframe stream
into the same explicit keyframes. v3 joint hashes use the shared lowercased ELF hash
(`rs_hash::elf_lower`). Every accepted container additionally retains its complete source bytes, so
an unedited `read -> write` reproduces the original file byte-for-byte (uncompressed v3/v4/v5 and
compressed `r3d2canm` alike). Editing a parsed animation (after `make_editable`) or writing an
in-memory animation emits uncompressed version 4, where full quaternions survive a round-trip
without quantization loss. Legacy skeletons are reported as errors.
